      <h2> HOW TO IMPROVE YOUR STUDY MEMORY </h2>
<p id="sec">Now before I go deep into my teachings, the human brains is divided into three sections:</p>
       </section><br>
       
           <div class="h">
               
 <mark>THE SENSORY REGISTER</mark>: This is the first stage of the human memory, it receives the Information. Information here don't last for a second, it quickly fade away. But the Information you pay attention to quickly moves to the short term memory.
 
     </div><br>
     
         <div class="h">
             
<mark>THE SHORT TERM MEMORY</mark>: The information you receives from the sensory register are being moved here (that the ones you pay attention to).
The information here doesn't last for 30 seconds, until you apply the retrieval methods, which I will be taking about before the informations can get to your long term memory.
         
       </div><br>
       <div class="h">
           
<mark>THE LONG TERM MEMORY</mark>: This is the final stage of your memory. Here the informations last for a very long time, and it a good place to store information.
Now we will be looking at what is called the <strong>CATTUFF </strong>memory improving system.
         
      </div><br>
      <div class="h">
        
C《 Change your study network: Change the kind of people you study with, that is always try to study with brilliant people who are far better than you in academics.
        
        </div><br>
        <div class="h">
            
A《 Adopt visualisation: whenever you see a picture, that image always remains in your brain for a long period of time. That is to say that pictures  transfer information than audio. So now, when you are being taught or studying try to create a picture out of that thing you are studying, it helps to remember fast what you have learnt.
           
            </div><br>
            <header class="h">
                <strong>
T《 The retrieval practices: Writing is a muscle activity that supports your memory. So when studying always try to write out like 2 to 3 times what you have read, because it can help your brain remember what you have read.
          </strong>
